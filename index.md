**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?** \
The whole topic of measuring a model's fairness and debiasing it is very interesting. At first, the topic seemed a bit confusing. Without concrete examples and knowledge of the different types of bias, the ability to successfully detect and mitigate bias seemed a bit complicated and far fetched. The further we move along within the replication project, the more I understand the exploration of bias and implementation of techniques to combat it. 

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.** \
I think it's important to explore a topic that has palpable impact on people. One investigation I could explore is credit score modeling bias. A model created could predict whether or not a person is likely to default on payments. In this case, if the model incorrectly predicts that someone would default, the person would not get a loan and would be negatively impacted. If the model incorrectly predicts that someone would not default, the bank would give out a loan to someone who is not equipted to pay it back, and both the bank and the person would be negatively impacted. The implementation of the AIF360 toolkit can help prevent biases towards groups of race, age, gender, etc. that are likely to exist in part due to historical bias.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?** \
The only change I would make has to do with the organization within the team. Some members are do a lot more work than others. For the next quarter, we (a different team) will do a better job of splitting up the work and communicating tasks and progress.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?** \
I want to delve deeper into optimizing the model and the data we feed into it. This will happen regardless with a more open-ended project. I would like to have more complex feature engineering and better model tuning, in addition to the use of the AIF360 toolkit to de-bias the models we create.
